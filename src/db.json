      "review": "Those of us in the hi-fi world might not have noticed it, but the wider world of consumer audio has been changing dramatically over the last several years, and the kind of audio systems that the average person is looking at does not much resemble the traditional setup of an audiophile. That traditional audiophile setup is made up of largish passive speakers, amplifier or integrated amp, preamplifier, and a host of other separate components depending on how intricate the user wants their system to be. That complexity is not appealing to 'normies' thereby giving rise to the market dominance of Bluetooth speakers and soundbars as the systems of choice for the average audio consumer. The problem with these simple user-friendly audio systems is that they just don't sound very good in comparison to serious speakers and audio electronics. They sacrifice a lot of performance for smaller size and convenience.",
